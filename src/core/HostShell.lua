-- POPEN IS NOT THREAD SAFE, and this app calls it from four threads (the main

--
-- On Darwin, popen() flushes every open stream first: _fwalk walks libc's
-- global FILE list and locks each entry as it goes.  pclose() frees a FILE and
-- takes it off that list.  Run the two concurrently and the walker can end up
-- waiting on the lock of a FILE another thread has already freed -- a wait
-- that nothing will ever satisfy.  That is the launcher freezing on close
-- after a visit to the mod tabs: sampling a hung process shows a fetch worker
-- parked in popen -> _fwalk -> flockfile with NO curl running anywhere on the
-- machine, and the main thread blocked in Thread:wait() for that worker, which
-- is why LOVE never reaches the process exit.
--
-- The fix is a process-wide mutex around the two list-mutating calls, and only
-- those: a LOVE Channel's performAtomic runs its callback holding the
-- channel's own mutex, which is the one lock primitive shared across love
-- threads.  Reading a pipe stays outside it, so the fetch pool still runs its

-- ------- HTTP transport ----------------------------------------------------
--
-- Every remote fetch (mod index, mod releases, thumbnails) used to shell out
-- to curl, which macOS / Windows 10+ / desktop Linux all ship and Android does
-- not: adding a mod index on Android died with "curl is not available on this
-- platform" (#597).  Android goes through the GameActivity.httpDownload JNI
-- bridge instead (HttpsURLConnection, using the INTERNET permission link play
-- already needs), surfaced by our vendored liblove as
-- love.system.httpDownload(url, absPath, userAgent, accept).  Both transports
-- block the calling thread and deal in whole files, so callers keep exactly
-- the contract they had with curl.

-- DIAGNOSING A FAILED FETCH.  curl's own stderr ("curl: (56) The requested
-- URL returned error: 403") went straight to the terminal, naming neither the
-- URL nor which of the launcher's many fetches produced it, while the caller
-- got back a generic "empty response".  Both curl branches below now merge
-- stderr into the pipe and ask curl for the HTTP status with --write-out, so
-- the message that reaches the UI and the log says which URL failed and how.
--
-- The status rides a marker rather than a bare "%{http_code}": a GET streams
-- its body through the same pipe, so the code has to be findable at the end
-- of arbitrary text.  Matched from the END, and only the last occurrence is
-- cut, so a body that happens to contain the marker keeps its content.
-- Two spellings on purpose.  HTTP_MARK is what comes back down the pipe; the
-- FMT one is what goes to curl, where the newline MUST be the two characters
-- backslash-n (curl expands the escape itself).  A literal newline inside the
-- argument would be quoted fine by a POSIX shell and be a syntax error in
-- cmd.exe, which has no multi-line quoted string.
